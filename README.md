The PRT (Project Readiness Test) conducted by Intellipaat is designed to assess a candidate's practical skills and knowledge in a specific technology or domain. The test typically involves real-world scenarios and tasks that simulate the challenges professionals face in the industry. By completing the PRT, candidates demonstrate their ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, proving their readiness for project work. The test is often used as a benchmark to gauge the preparedness of individuals before they undertake live projects or advance to more complex training modules.
